## Using private models from huggingface hub

If you want to use private models from huggingface hub, then you need to login using `huggingface-cli login` command.

Note: You can also save your generations directly to huggingface hub if your output path points to a huggingface hub dataset repo and you have access to push to that repository. Thus, you will end up saving a lot of disk space. 

## Acknowledgements

I would like to express my gratitude to the following individuals and organizations for sharing their code, which formed the basis of the implementation used in this project:

- [Tencent ARC](https://github.com/TencentARC) for their code for the [GFPGAN](https://github.com/TencentARC/GFPGAN) package, which was used for image super-resolution.
- [LexKoin](https://github.com/LexKoin) for their code for the [Real-ESRGAN-UpScale](https://github.com/LexKoin/Real-ESRGAN-UpScale) package, which was used for image enhancement.
- [Hugging Face](https://github.com/huggingface) for their code for the [diffusers](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers) package, which was used for optimizing the model's parameters.
- [Abhishek Thakur](https://github.com/abhishekkrthakur) for sharing his code for the [diffuzers](https://github.com/abhishekkrthakur/diffuzers) package, which was also used for optimizing the model's parameters.

I am grateful for their contributions to the open source community, which made this project possible.
